# Procedural Art Generator (Python)

A beginner-friendly creative coding project using Python and Pillow for procedural image transformations.  
This project explores how to apply basic image filters like Gaussian blur, edge detection, and contour extraction â€” foundational steps for building generative art tools.

## Features
- Load images and apply visual filters
- Save processed output
- Modular setup for adding more advanced effects later (pixel sorting, channel shifting, etc.)

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: Pillow, NumPy, OpenCV (for future effects), Matplotlib

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip3 install pillow numpy opencv-python matplotlib imageio
